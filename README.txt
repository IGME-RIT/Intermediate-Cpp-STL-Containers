Welcome to the STL Tutorial!
Prerequesites: None

STL stands for Standard Template Library
The Standard Template Library has dozens of useful tools that
can help us with our code. std::vector is an example of STL, it 
is templated so that you can make a vector of any type of data.
Today we will learn about more elements of STL:

std::vector
std::stack
std::queue
std::list

std::deque is not in this tutorial, but it
is literally a combination of a stack and a 
queue, where data can enter and exit from
both ends of the list
